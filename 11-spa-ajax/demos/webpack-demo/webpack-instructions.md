"Webpack provides a great developer experience as it not only bundles JavaScript applications (supporting both EcmaScript Modules and CommonJS), but when paired with plugins and loaders it can be used for taking care of dependencies and assets, such as images, fonts, SASS, CSS, etx. Webpack goes through your project and builds a dependency graph based on what is imported and exported."
