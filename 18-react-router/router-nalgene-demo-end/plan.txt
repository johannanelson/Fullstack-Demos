DEMO 101
- Import browserRouter and wrap Main component (index.js)
- Import route and define routes in main component (#main-section)
- Make sure that main app component returns a nav bar, then the routes
- Import Link and replace all a tags in nav bar with the Link component tags
- Note that even when I change the URL, the component is not updating - this is because of fuzzy matching. Fuzzily matching the first slash to be the other paths as well. To precisely match a path, use "exact path" - for exact path = '/', must be just /, can't have anything else after it
- Show that no requests are being made

DEMO 201
- Console log props for a single component - add props in as an argument to the component definition
- Update syntax from component to render for Routes.
- First log without passing props in
- Add a prop in
- Add routeProps argument to anonymous function - first show not spreading (routeProps = {routeProps}), then spreading ({...routeProps})
