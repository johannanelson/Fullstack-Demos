Wouldn't it be nice to have a way to get a single pokemon without having to write different queries for each different id? Let's use express!
----------------------
Create POKEMONROUTES.js
10. First, make sure to export client in index. js so that it can be used in other places. Comment out all lines in try block except for client.connect()
11. Require express, define app, and require client from index.js
12. Write a route to get all pokemon
13. Change start script to run pokemonRoutes, then run
14. Write a route to get single pokemon and test that out
IF TIME: show sql injection attack (pokemon/3; DROP TABLE pokemon;)
15. Show placeholders instead of template literals

Data flow: we're sending a request from a browser, look for the corresponding route. Our server acts like a client, when it requests data from the database using the pg client.

-----------------------
REORGANIZATION
16. Place index.js inside db folder. Add routes folder and create new studentRoutes file. Rename studentRoutes to be the new index.js of our entire directory - new main entrypoint.

STUDENTROUTES.JS
17. Change from app to router in pokemonRoutes.js and export router.
18. Require client
19. Add app.use in index.js
20. Add url specification and change routes in studentRoutes
